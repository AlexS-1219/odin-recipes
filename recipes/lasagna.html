        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? 
                It's a great way to feed a crowd and 
                a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. 
                It freezes well. It reheats well. 
                Leftovers will keep you happy for days.

            <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me 
                his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has
                 been cooking since his college days. Alton's 
                 original recipe created enough lasagna for a 
                 small army so I halved it. What is posted here
                  will easily serve eight people.
